2. Operating System: macOS Monterey

3. IDE: Visual Studio Code 1.63.2

4. Instruction for running executables
	i) DigitRecognizerTestModel.py, DigitRecognizerTrain.py, greekSymbol.py, liveStream.py, networkExamine.py, ownExperiment.py, preTrainedExtension.py are programs that can be individually run, explaining in depth below.
	ii) lib.py contains all the supporting functions
	iii) network.py contains all the models.

5. DigitRecognizerTrain.py - Trains and creates the models
   DigitRecognizerTestModel.py - Loads the trained model and runs the testing
   greekSymbol.py - Task 3
   liveStream.py - Live digit identification
   networkExamine.py - Task 2
   ownExperiment.py - Task 4
   preTrainedExtension.py - Extension

   Other extensions mentioned in wiki are added as part of the program so no separate files.
